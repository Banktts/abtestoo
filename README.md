# abtest
A/B testing from scratch

## Frequentist Approach

See interactive notebook `frequentist.ipynb` / open in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cstorm125/abtest/blob/master/frequentist_colab.ipynb)

Frequentist A/B testing is one of the most used and abused statistical methods in the world. This article starts with a simple problem of comparing two online ads campaigns (or teatments, user interfaces or slot machines). It outlines several useful statistical concepts and how we exploit them to solve our problem. At the end, it acknowledges some common pitfalls we face when doing a frequentist A/B test and proposes some possible solutions to a more robust A/B testing. Readers are encouraged to tinker with the widgets provided in order to explore the impacts of each parameter.
